# MovieLens_Victor_SOTO  
**School Project - Recommender System**

---

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to build a simple recommender system using the [MovieLens100k dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). 
This project explores key concepts in recommendation systems, including collaborative filtering and evaluation metrics.

## Dataset  
The **MovieLens100k** dataset contains:  
- **100,000 ratings** (1-5) from 943 users on 1,682 movies.  
- Additional metadata such as genres, release years, and user demographics.  
- Ratings are timestamped and cover a broad range of movie preferences.
