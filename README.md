**School Project - Recommender System**

---

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to build a simple recommender system using the [MovieLens100k dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). 
This project explores key concepts in recommendation systems, including collaborative filtering and evaluation metrics.

---

## Dataset  
The **MovieLens100k** dataset consists of:
	* **100,000** ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	* Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
  * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
